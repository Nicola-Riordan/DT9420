    "1. Look at the documentation for lists at https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/ and/or https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range\n",
    "\n",

    "2. How would you implement a counter in a `for` loop? That is, as you iterate through the items in a sequence, how do you count how many times you run the loop? Show this with pseudocode.\n",

    "    How would you just output every third item?\n",

    " - working with common data interchange formats (google might help...)  \n",

    "    Hint below if needed\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Write a program that takes a month numeral from the user and returns the text month and the season that the month is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extend the above program to also return the number of days in the month entered. Hint below if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Write a program that makes a shopping list, with the user able to enter an item and the number of items required. Then print the list, and the total number of items needed. Hint below if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function which finds the largest of a list of numbers. Do not use a method, compare each element to the current maximum. Use a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a program that gives the user a menu with the following options:\n",
    "    - A Add an element to a list\n",
    "    - R Remove an element from the list\n",
    "    - P Replace an element with another\n",
    "    - S sort the list\n",

    "_hint 1: you will need to use the modulus operator_  \n",

For example, there is a list of names in a class, and the class is to be divided into two fairly, splicing the list so that every second name from the list in alphabetical order is put in one group and every other name is put into the second group is a fair way of splitting a class.<br>\n",

This can make it easier to group items together in order to find them more easily, or delete them more quickly. For example, a list holds 10 separate class lists each containing 5-10 names.
